# Project-1 HANGMAN

# Instructions: 
One letter at a time select words that you think are in the secret word. Players have 6 attempts to guess from 26 letters. Once a letter is selceted that letter button selected will fade out and will be disabled and then replaces the underscore with a letter in the secret word. Every wrong letter button gives you one less attempt.
